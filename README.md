## Summary

- Webpage is clearly show all the information and user is able to find all the information they need in one page wihout any other direction

## Impprovement recommendations

- Basic the information on data.js , this page is holding all the date from there but client they probebly does not need that information and that could be a problem to find the exactly information if the data becomes larger. We are able to make a filter to help user to esily find the accurate infromation they need or sorting this information by default syntax.

- We can create a summary page link to show how many entries on this page, another drawback for this data is lack of the visible  relevant data. User they are supposed to spend less time to find the most perfect data.
